                    Hello there! I'm Lucas, a passionate tech enthusiast with a background in computer sciences and software development. My journey began with maintaining and managing WordPress sites, and over time, I've expanded my skills into programming, taking courses in JavaScript, Python, SQL, and more. I'm proficient in HTML, CSS, SASS, Vanilla JavaScript, and recently venturing into JavaScript frameworks, such as React.js, Angular and Vue.js which has given me a solid foundation to create web applications and interfaces.

                    In my previous job experiences, I acquired hands-on experience in process management and on providing both technical and user suport. My roles also allowed me to develop strong organizational and comunicational skills as I managed the company's IT equipment and supplies, being encharged of procurement and oversee computers maintenance.
